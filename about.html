            You are a web developer at a service-based web development company called Kite Technologies. The company has
            been approached by a client who wants to build a website for their restaurant named Mingâ€™s Diner. The
            website should provide the users a brief overview of the restaurant and its bestsellers, its address, as
            well as an option to contact the restaurant. During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and
            develop the website.
